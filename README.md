# App Garage demo

This example shows how to leverage Okteto to develop a Ruby on Rails app with a React frontend directly in the cloud. The app is deployed using raw Kubernetes manifests.

## Branches

1. `add search` has the code to add the react search component.
1. `add tracing` has the code to start emitting traces to the jaeger collector.
1. `final-version` has all the code integrated.
